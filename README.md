Snap is the recommended way to install Heimer on Linux.

## Building the project

Currently the build depends on `Qt5` only (`qt5-default`, `qttools5-dev-tools`, `qttools-dev` packages on Ubuntu).

The "official" build system for Linux is `CMake` although `qmake` project files are also provided.

Building for Linux in a nutshell:

`$ mkdir build && cd build`

`$ cmake ..`

`$ make -j4`

Run unit tests:

`$ ctest`

Install locally:

`$ sudo make install`

Debian package (`.deb`) can be created like this:

`$ cpack -G DEB`

See `Jenkinsfile` on how to build other packages in Docker.
